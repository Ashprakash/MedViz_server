It's the unhealthiest place to have it. As for weight loss, to lose weight you must consume fewer calories than you burn no matter how much exercise you do.

So if you're not losing then you are consuming more calories than you burn, even if you think you're not.

That is, you can't spot reduce. ... My suggestion is to keep up with regular aerobic exercise 3-5 times a week for a minimum of 30 minutes (that's enough, but you can go up to 45 minutes if you like), add interval training once you increase your stamina (unless you're already aerobically fit) and start resistance exercise 2-3 days per week, being sure to do large muscle group exercises like squats, deadlifts, side bends, and spinal twists, in addition to all the other muscle groups.

Now we have new data from a report in the Archives of Internal Medicine that found that even if you have a normal overall weight, if youve got excess belly fat and thus a larger than normal waist circumference, you have a much greater chance of dying from any cause over a decade. The researchers looked at 48,500 men and 56,343 women 50 and older who completed questionnaires for the Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort. During the study period, 9,315 men and 5,332 women died. Heres what they found: Men whose waists were 47 inches or larger, and women whose girth exceeded 42 inches, had twice the risk of dying compared to those who had normal-sized waists (less than 40 inches for a man, and less than 35 inches for women). Heres the rub. The BMI (body mass index which should be less than 25) didnt matter. Waist size, not just BMI, is a powerful predictor for death. The bulging belly problem reaches across all ages, but is especially troublesome for men and women over the age of 40. Some studies have noted that over half of men over 50 and 70 percent of women 50+ have larger-than-recommended girths. The study also found that people who had four extra inches around their waist had a 15-25% increased risk of dying. For reasons no one understands, the strongest increase (25%) was in women with larger than normal waistlines and a normal BMI. This means you could be 5 feet 5 inches and weigh 130 pounds with a normal BMI of 21.6, but if your waist size is 35 inches or larger, then your risk of dying increases by 25%. So, normal weight folks out are not out of the woods unless their girth is under control. Heres something everyone needs to be aware of. As you age, and especially if youre sedentary and not physically active on a regular basis, its much easier to lose muscle and replace it with fat. So, dont be fooled into complacency because the scale hasnt changed much. Your waistline has. How does this new information impact on you right now? Here are my thoughts: 1. Measure up. Grab a tape measure and whip it around your belly button. If youre a guy whose girth is 40 inches or greater, or a gal whose belly is 35 or more, listen up. Its irrelevant what your weight and BMI are. You need to get that belly reduced below 40 and 35 inches respectively. 2. Become a waist watcher. Pay attention to your waist measurement over time. In a log book, keep track of your overall weight, BMI, body fat percentage and waist measurement. These numbers will give you a much more accurate assessment of your body composition, as well as risk for future problems. Look at pictures of yourself over time. Its an eye opener for many folks to see the shape shifting that occurs as we age. 3. Mind your belt. Women, get out of your elastic waistbands. You can add 20 pounds and barely know it when you wear those kinds of garments. Instead, get more fitted clothes and belts, which help to keep you connected with your mind and body. Watch out for Muffin Top  belly fat plopping over your waistline. If youve got it, work to remove it. Men, watch out for BOB  belly over belt. 4. Healthy lifestyle habits are the answer. Strive to burn 400 calories everyday by moving around more and adding intensity when you can. Weight lifting is very important as it builds a more powerful calorie-burning engine that will help sustain any weight removal youve achieved. Do it twice per week. Pay more attention to the quality, quantity and frequency of your food consumption. Whole foods please! Watch the portions. Most of you are eating way beyond what you need. End your eating by 8 p.m. each night when you can. And get plenty of sleep. Sleep-deprived folks have larger bellies.

On the other hand, it also is possible for pain from organs within the abdomen to be felt outside of the abdomen. For example, the pain of pancreatic inflammation may be felt in the back.

If not, then I would have to have a colostomy. I was lucky I didn't need that. However, the symptoms returned a couple of years after that surgery and another procedure was done. No, no colostomy.

I have been on an anti-inflammatory diet lately and have kept a food diary. I found out that I have a problem with almonds as well as corn and that it is best for me to keep cheese consumption to a minimum (probably because it is inflammatory). Good foods to eat would include fruits and veggies, fish, avocados (which have anti-inflammatory effects), lentils, and foods that have not been highly processed. Taking probiotics may also help. Keep your blood sugar balanced as much as possible. This will help with the shakes. So will the diet and probiotics, as it will help your body absorb more nutrition. As far as the cramps go, I think that the contraceptive may be playing a big part in that. getting more exercise when you feel well enough to do it may help. I don't really know what to tell you about that. I don't think the two are related. When you have kept your food diary for a few weeks or month (s), it would be a good idea to discuss it with a doctor. They may order some tests or they may be able to give even better advice.

Unfortunately, the answer is no. Any time the skin is cut with an incision, a scar will develop. That's just the plain truth. There are several things you can do after surgery to minimize the appearance of a scar, but it will always be there. After your incision has healed (and after your surgeon has given his permission), you can try massaging the scar several times a day using as much pressure as you can tolerate. A scar is basically a buildup of fibrous tissue. The more you massage this tissue and break it up, the less noticeable the scar may be. You don't need to use a fancy product while doing this scar massage, either. Plain lotion is fine. It's the mechanical action of the massage that matters. When I was a plastic surgery nurse, the surgeon I worked for always told patients to avoid applying pure Vitamin E oil to any incision. This can cause reddening of the scar in some people. However, a lotion or cream containing Vitamin E is fine. Remember that your scar should continue to fade over time. If your scar is unattractive to you, there are some relatively new products on the market called silicone sheets or gel patches that seem to work quite well to help minimize scars. They're also rather expensive. Reminder: NO scar massage before your surgeon says it's OK. Your incision needs to be fully healed before you start massaging it.

Acetaminophen or Tylenol is also referred to as APAP in some formulations. You want to be careful. You want to make sure that you don't exceed more than 4,000 milligrams a day for an adult. If you are an elderly person, you don't want to exceed 2,000 milligrams a day, and you would want to avoid things like alcohol.

They weren't aware that they were taking prescription medications with acetaminophen in it. So you want to talk to your pharmacist first before you consider choosing these products. On the Advil/Motrin side, once again, you don't want to drink alcohol with them. It really helps create nausea. It could upset the stomach. If you have an ulcer, it's not recommended. If you have asthma, it's not recommended either, because ibuprofen is a sister to aspirin and it could trigger an asthma attack. That's really, some people are very sensitive to this class, and that's why they shouldn't be taking it. So once again, you want to come to the pharmacy, you want to ask for the pharmacist. You want to come with your medication list, show us what you are taking, and then tell us what are your symptoms.

Now, they are used to treat pain, but it depends on what that person's pain level is. So I always make sure that my patients are going to a pain specialist and that their pain is being reassessed on an annual.

We are also learning through some DNA technology that some people who have pain may take these medications and they may not work at all, because their DNA has certain triggers in it that it makes their medications just not work. So therefore, we have to figure out what are other options to treat their pain more effectively. So a great question. Once again though with pain, we want to make sure it's individualized.

Normally, acne develops between the age of 12-25 years. However, acne is not limited to any particular age group. As people grow and become older or in younger people, acne is becoming a point of concern. Acne is known as the disease of the pilosebaceous units (PSUs). PSUs are found underneath the skin surface but are more in number on the face, back, and chest. PSUs consist of oil glands (sebaceous gland). These oil glands secrete oil to the skin which makes skin moisturized and soft. But in case of any pathophysiological changes in these glands due to external or internal factors can lead to acne this can be either be blackheads or whiteheads. for more information on this you can visit drugsdropship24. The acne triggering factors are listed below: Oil glands are over stimulated by increase secretion of sex hormones called androgens that release in both boys and girls during adolescence. Diseases like polycystic ovary syndrome and Cushing's syndrome Hormonal changes due to menstruation, pregnancy or hormonal therapy like birth control pills Cosmetic mostly moisturizers and oily preparations Genetics Pathogenic invasion like Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis Secondary physical factors such as diet, personal hygiene (dirt, sweat) and stress Incidence of Acne On the basis of age: Acne affects 90% teenagers. Acne generally begins with the onset of adolescence, when androgen concentration begins to increase in the body On the basis of gender: Acne is more common in males than females during puberty.

Though stress can aggravate acne, it clearly does not cause it. Hormones. Common acne in teenagers starts with an increase in hormone production. During puberty, both boys and girls produce high levels of androgens, the male sex hormones that include testosterone. Testosterone signals the body to make more sebum, a waxy substance that helps the skin retain moisture. Bacteria. Excess sebum clogs the openings to hair follicles -- especially those on the face, neck, chest, and back. Bacteria grow in these clogged follicles. This makes blackheads or whiteheads form on the skin's surface -- a condition called non-inflammatory acne. Sometimes the follicle wall breaks under the pressure of this buildup. When this happens, sebum leaks into nearby tissues and forms a pustule -- this is called inflammatory acne. This can create cysts. Ruptured cysts can leave temporary or permanent scars. Depending on the type of pill, oral contraceptives may trigger acne in some women but suppress it in others. Steroids taken by some bodybuilders and other athletes can also lead to severe outbreaks. Acne has many subtypes. Acne neonatorum and acne infantum occasionally affect newborns and infants, usually boys. A pimply rash appears on the face but usually clears within weeks with no lasting effect. People who escaped their teen years almost pimple free may develop persistent adult-onset acne as they get older. Despite the normal increase in androgen levels during puberty, some doctors believe that flare-ups of acne have less to do with androgen levels than with how a person's skin responds to an increase in sebum production. The bacteria Propionibacterium acnes and Staphylococcus epidermidis occur naturally in healthy hair follicles. If too many of them accumulate in plugged follicles, they may secrete enzymes that break down sebum and cause inflammation. Some people are simply more sensitive than others to this reaction. Sebum levels that might cause a pimple or two in one person may result in widespread outbreaks -- or even acute cystic acne -- in another person.

These are not surgical instruments, you should not be doing this to your skin. So I do prefer those blackhead removing tools over using your fingers and a tissue. But I also think that this is something that should be done by your dermatologist, in order to have the best chance at extracting the contents of that blackhead without leaving a scar. So anytime you pick at the skin in any way; whether it's using the tool or your fingers, you do have some risk of scarring. So every pimple, blackhead, whitehead, or a pustule, or papule, all starts out as a same thing. Our face is covered with lots of little hair follicles, which are called pores. At the base of those follicles there can be some bacteria that grows as well, called P. acnes. For some reason, which we don't fully understand why that is, the opening of the follicle can become blocked, and that means that all the contents behind it has no place to go, it can't get to the surface. So as it builds up, it can create a little bump on the surface and it can look a little bit white, that's a whitehead. If it opens to the surface, it gets oxidized, and that's a blackhead. So a blackhead isn't dark because it's dirty, it's dark because there is oxidation that goes on and makes it look dark. If there is a P. acnes bacteria that's growing at the base of that follicle, now that the follicle is closed, this kind of bacteria loves an environment where there is no oxygen. So once the covering gets closed, there is no more oxygen, the bacteria wakes up, and it has all this great food; its got the oils from the oil glands that are produced there, and all the proteins from the skin cells that are clogged behind it. And now its got an abundance of food supplies, so it starts to flourish, and that can look like a pimple. So when you pick at it, what you do is you create an inflammatory response, which makes it red and angry and can make it more likely to persist or last longer and more likely to scar, and more likely to come back in the same spot, so picking is very bad. But your dermatologist can help extract that for you, or give you a treatment, like a retinoid or a topical antibiotic, that can get rid of that pimple for you much more quickly and safely.

Those can be avoided in the future, so they can still get great sun protection. If you really are allergic to the sunscreen ingredient, you need to look for sun protective clothing.

Sweat does not cause acne. Especially during the teen years, hormone levels can stimulate excessive oil production. Along with those hormones circulating throughout the body causing the excess oil, the skin is going through a stage of change that predisposes it to clogging. That pore clogging can develop into pustules, pimples, whiteheads, and blackheads. Most foods do not cause acne. With that said, it is suggested to eat a healthy and balanced diet. Some anecdotal accountings recommend either reducing or eliminating chocolate, carbonated beverages, caffeine products, excess sodium, and fried foods. Despite extensive marketing through info commercial and lofty prices, there is no silver bullet product solution to curing acne. Here are some recommendations and treatment that can lessen the acne outbreaks: Even though acne is not directly caused by dirt, keep your face clean and free of excess bacteria can reduce pore clotting. Do not be overly aggressive in the face washing. Applying too much pressure to the affected areas can actually aggravate the situation. From my own teenage years, applying an astringent following face washing was very beneficial. Cleaning pads containing salicylic acid can cause improvement and are relatively cost effective. Be careful about using cover-up makeup products which can further cause pore clotting. Do not be tempted to pop the acne blisters as this may cause spreading and infection. Keep your body well hydrated and exercise on a regular basis. Sleep for eight hours each night. You can search out acne home remedy treatments. The internet is loaded with various homemade recipes that may help. A paste made up of common everyday products such as baking soda and lemon juice work for some individuals. If improvement does not occur within 2 months of applying the above principles, then it is time to consult with a doctor. They may prescribe medications such as Retin-A, Accutane, Antibiotics, and others to treat the acne. Stay calm and positive. Do not become overly stressed and allow acne to control your life. With extra efforts directed at maintaining optimal physical health, you should see positive results in reducing acne.

Some individuals find help quitting Heroin abuse through an outpatient medical detox program; however most people are more successful when they seek heroin detox through an inpatient medical detox program - where they can receive around-the-clock care and counseling.

This is from WWW.Patient.co.uk Definition of Dependence (DSM-IV) (Presence of three or more features, for a year or more) Tolerance: a need for markedly increased amounts of the substance to achieve intoxication or desired effect or markedly diminished effect with continued use of the same amount of the substance. Withdrawal: the characteristic withdrawal syndrome for the substance or the same (or a closely related) substance is taken to relieve or avoid withdrawal symptoms. The substance is often taken in larger amounts or over a longer period than was intended. There is a persistent desire or unsuccessful efforts to cut down or control substance abuse. A great deal of time is spent in activities necessary to obtain the substance, use the substance or recover from its effects. Important social, occupational or recreational activities are given up or reduced because of substance use. The substance use is continued despite knowledge of having a persistent or recurrent physical or psychological problem that is likely to have been caused or exacerbated by the substance. Following advice from the Committee on Safety of Medicines (CSM) in 1988,[ 3 ] the overall prescribing of benzodiazepines has markedly reduced.[ 4 ][ 5 ] A study from Kings College London showed that, within this figure, their use as hypnotics has reduced but their use as anxiolytics has increased.[ 6 ] Recreational use of benzodiazepines is also an increasing problem. In 2010, they represented 1% of drugs used as adjuncts to drugs of primary dependence such as cocaine in the UK.[ 4 ] The problem is in the end they will both kill you.

Acne is caused by hormones; specifically the male hormones called androgens. The worst cases of acne are usually experienced during puberty, a time when hormones are fluctuating wildly.

Other women have serious problems with androgens and suffer from a condition called polycystic ovarian syndrome. The women who suffer from adult hormonal acne have breakouts mainly around their chin and lips. This form of acne typically beings after age 25 and can plague a women throughout the course of her life. This becomes even worse as she becomes peri-menopausal and menopausal because her female hormones are decreasing, allowing the male hormones to have a greater affect on her skin.

If you wish to try these formulations, try them only every two or three days rather than on a daily basis. Use just a small amount and only directly on the lesions rather on your entire face. Watch what you put on your face. Steer clear of makeup and skin moisturizers that contain butyl stearate, lanolin, lauryl alcohol, oleic acid, vegetable butters, oils, and waxes.

With some exceptions, this provision would require all U.S. citizens to purchase health insurance or face a penalty beginning in 2014. At 53, with an annual income of $12,000, this reader would likely qualify for Medicaid. Starting in 2014, states will receive additional funding from the federal government to cover the cost of extending Medicaid benefits. If you're an individual making $14,000 per year or a family of four earning $29,000 or less (133 percent of the federal poverty level), you would receive health benefits via Medicaid and avoid paying a penalty. Helping the Middle Class Pay for Insurance For the middle class, tax credits will be made available to help pay for health plans purchased through health insurance exchanges that will be set up by 2014. If you're an individual making $43,000 or less, or a family of four making less than $88,000, the government will subsidize your insurance premiums. You may also be eligible for reduced co-payments, coinsurance, and deductibles to assist with the cost of coverage. But if you fail to obtain insurance, you will be penalized. Here's how it breaks down: Starting in 2014 the tax penalty will be $95 and that amount will gradually increase to the greater of $695 per year for individuals, $2085 per family or 2.5 percent of a household's income. There will be exemptions for financial hardship. The Individual Mandate -- A Little Background The individual mandate was included in the new law as a way of paying for an additional 30 million uninsured Americans to have insurance by requiring everyone to pay into the system. This is one the most hotly debated aspects of the new law. A number of lawsuits have been filed around the country questioning whether or not it is constitutional to require Americans to purchase a product, in this case, health insurance. Recent rulings in Michigan and Virginia upheld the new law. However, earlier this week, a federal judge in Richmond, Va. ruled against it, saying that the individual mandate to purchase health insurance violates the Constitution. All this is to say that there will be many legal battles between now and 2014 when this mandate is scheduled to take effect. Ultimately the decision as to whether it's legal for the government to require people to purchase health insurance will likely fall to the Supreme Court.

Rates will also vary based on where you live. Under the law, insurers will be allowed to charge more for people who live in areas where medical costs are high. There have been many reports warning of potential rate increases once the Affordable Care Act takes full effect. One of the biggest concerns is that limits on how much insurers can charge older people will cause premiums to skyrocket for young people. That, critics warn, will keep young, healthy people out of the insurance pools, which will in turn cause costs to rise. As I wrote a few weeks ago, a recent report by the Urban Institute found that most people buying plans through the state-based insurance markets being set up under the law will qualify for financial assistance to help pay for the cost of their coverage. Individuals earning nearly $46,000 and families of four earning up to $94,000 annually will qualify for a tax break to help lower the cost of coverage.

However, if your employer tells you it is eliminating insurance because of the law, I would be wary of the answer. In fact, the law requires all employers with 50 or more workers to either offer health insurance coverage or to pay a penalty for failing to do so. They'll also pay a penalty if at least one full-time employee receives a subsidy to help buy insurance through one of the new marketplaces. Today, 98% of employers with more than 200 workers already offer health insurance, as do 94% of businesses with 50 to 199 employees. And, theyve providing insurance long before the ACA became law for a host of good reasons the law doesn't change. For one, providing insurance is a tax-free form of compensation. And, a good benefits package helps employers compete for employees. We have heard of some small employers holding off on hiring for fear of crossing the 50-employee threshold  it could certainly raise an employer's costs if they currently employ fewer than 50 workers and dont offer insurance. And, some industries with part-time or contract workers are also reducing hours to avoid raising insurance costs because the law requires large employers to insure workers who put in on average 30 hours per week. But for small companies, the law in many cases increases health plan choices and for very small companies provides tax credits that can lower insurance costs. I would need to know more about your particular employer's situation, but on the face of it, it doesn't seem eliminating insurance if it's already being offered makes sense because of the health reform law.

The ACA (Obamacare) mandated a certain level of benefits that must be included in all health plans. This is identical to the what every state legislature does when it mandates what is minimum coverage for auto insurance. One wants to know that if someone crashes into you that they at least have enough insurance to fix your car, if not their own. The exchanges are simply PRIVATE insurance companies competing for business in a marketplace. They are all quoting the same benefit packages and are simply competing at price. No one demanded or required them to compete for this business or offer insurance in the exchanges. Some exchanges have more companies offering insurance than others. These private companies are doing so because they think they can make a few bucks. It is not some government conspiracy to take over the insurance business. That having been said, one may notice that no other industrialized nation on earth has seen fit to copy our health care system. It simply has not worked, and I personally see very little on the horizon to make me believe it will work in the future. In fact, in response to the writer who suggested more universal plans are not working and are unpopular might look only to our neighbor to the north whose health care system is quite popular with Canadian citizens. I know, I know, Canadians are marching to the US for their health care needs. This post is to short to actually address this issue, but suffice to say Canadians are NOT coming in any great numbers to the US for their basic health care needs. Actually, when you factor out tourists from Canada who receive emergency treatment, the incidence of Canadians coming to the US is actually quite small, and is comprised almost exclusively of higher income individuals seeking elective surgery due to the wait in Canada for those types of services. Take a look around the world and compare the healthcare systems of other advanced societies. Many have found ways to both meet the needs of their citizens and do it at significantly less money than we spend. For your research pleasure I would recommend looking at that downtrodden and financially irresponsible country of Switzerland as an example of how we might address this issue ion the future. See the book  The Healing of America; A Global Quest for Better, Cheaper, and Fairer Health Care  by T.R. Reid.

As a child, my definition of discipline involved either a spanking, time-out, or a combination of the two. However modern definition of discipline is not so much about punishment, but instilling values. At 9 months, a child can easily be trained on his or her behaviour. Consider any of the following tactics from Dr. Sears: 1. Guide little hands Exploring hands are always looking for things to handle, so give the young explorer word associations to help him sort out what he or she may touch. Try  yes touch  for safe things;  no touch  for objects off-limits; and  soft touch  for faces and animals. To tame the impulsive grabber, try encouraging  the one finger touch.  other words (e.g., hot touch, owie touch) will come to mind as you discover the world of touch together. 2. Respect little grabbers For a young toddler, make eye contact and divert his or her attention to something else he or she would like. For an older toddler, tell her you'll help her get what she wants. This is simply an exercise in politeness and respect, an  adult-in- charge  approach. Children need adults to communicate and model the behavior adults expect. 3. Distract and divert When your child begins acting up, get his attention by calling his name or some other cue word that you have learned will stop him in his tracks long enough to distract him. Then, quickly divert him toward a safer alternative. 4. Offer redirectors A baby's mind is filled with hundreds of word associations. Try creating verbal cues that the child will interpret as safe behaviour. For instance, try using the word  go  to let the child know it is time to go outside and play. Later when he initiates bad behaviour, you can say the word  go  and he will be distracted by the thought of going out to play. 5. Set Limits Much of your discipline depends upon your ability to set limits. Humans need limits, and the younger the child the more defined should be the limits. Boundaries provide security for the child whose adventurous spirit leads him to explore, but his inexperience may lead him astray. Limit-setting teaches a valuable lesson for life: the world is full of yeses and nos. You decide what behavior you cannot allow and stick to that limit. This will be different for each family and each stage of development. Setting limits introduces a new level of frustration, which every child must experience on the homefront before he is hit with it in the world outside the door. You set the limits by making him stop misbehaving and teach him to play nicely. 6. Take Charge We want to clearly be in charge of our toddlers so that they feel safe and secure with someone standing between them and the dangers of the big world, with a place to go for help. We don't want to control them like puppets so that we feel powerful. First, let them know by your tone of voice and our actions that you are mature adults. Second, by being available as a safe and secure homebase they can leave and return to you at will for comfort and reassurance. In this way, we could help them develop their own inner controls. 7. Provide structure When your child reaches one year of age, another title is added to the parenting job description: architect of your child's environment. By taking on this job you steer the child's energies toward enjoyable learning experiences and away from harm. You create structure, which does not mean being inflexible, repressive, or domineering. What we mean by  structure  is setting the conditions that encourage desirable behavior to happen. Structure protects and redirects. You free the child to be a child and provide the opportunity to grow and mature. Structure creates a positive environment for the child. By a bit of preplanning you remove most of the  no's  so that a generally  yes  environment prevails.

The elderly may be seen in a soiled condition and it may be assumed that the individual is incontinent. In frequent cases, this conjecture is not factually based. Typically tell-tale signs of a UTI such as burning, changes in urine color, the need to void frequently, possible blood in the urine, fever and a need to urinate urgently are missing ingredients from the picture with an elderly person. Instead, and totally unintended by staff and family members, focus is generated towards the patient's emotional decline and the UTI is overlooked as the basic cause of their negative behavior. Another reason for the diagnostic delay is that weve been conditioned, by way of urinary tract infections occurring in younger groups, to be associated with frequent sexual activety accompanied with multiple partners. Here are some suggestive actions : The sooner that a UTI is diagnosed, the sooner that anti-biotic treatment can be started and medical resolution can occur.

As for foods or nutrients that reverse aging, vitamin A is certainly one of those, and it comes from a variety of sources.

First, how did people come to the notion that red wine might have some heart healthiness to it? There's an observation called  the French Paradox  ...that emerged when scientists noted a relatively low incidence of coronary heart disease among the French, despite a high incidence of smoking and a diet heavy in fats (cheese, creams, etc). This notion gained widespread attention in the 1990s after it was covered in a story on  60 Minutes.  It has spurred a great deal of scientific intrigue into whether or not a moderate amount of red wine consumption might balance some other dietary indiscretions. Bottom line, we don't know the answer definitively. Most believe that a modest amount of daily alcohol has some health benefits. Some believe that this benefit is pronounced with red wine, due to some particular chemicals that are part of the grape skin. In fact, companies have been formed to explore whether some of these compounds might be extracted and developed as drugs to treat/prevent heart disease. Now, back to your question. While drinking fine aged red wine is truly a delight, there's no evidence (yet) to suggest that this might be better for your health than more simple, less expensive wines. The key is moderation! So, enjoy your glass after work or with dinner tonight and stay tuned for more evidence as the story evolves.

Studies now confirm what we all knew to be true - prolonged stress does lead to premature and rapid aging of every cell in the body. Stress is the ultimate mind-body connection. When we perceive stress, our body responds rapidly with a multitude of changes. Changes intended to prepare us for the fight or flight response. Our heart rate goes up, our blood pressure increases, blood flow is increased to the brain, heart and muscles. Protective hormones, adrenaline and other chemicals begin surging through the bloodstream, nerves begin firing, all senses are brought to peak awareness. All this so we are in a state of extreme readiness to take on any threat. This was good hundreds and thousands years ago. What about today? Stress is inevitable. With so much stress from work and life that is not a threat to our survival, what does all this stress do to our bodies? Long term, intense stress is not good for the body and accelerates aging. This is especially true if you dont feel in control over the things that are causing stress. When the stresses do not resolve, your immune system is weakened. Stressed individuals become ill more frequently. Excessive stress actually shortens the life span of the cells throughout the body, so that every tissue and organ is ages rapidly. The body begins accumulating highly toxic levels of free radical particles that cause even more oxidative damage to cells and tissues. Damage that promotes aging. And because the stress response is so quick to come on and so slow to fade, it is likely that those in prolonged high stress occupations like [the United States] President begin to age rapidly - an aging process we can see over time in their face, graying of hair, and behavior. The answer? Do your best to avoid or reduce excessive and prolonged stress. If that is not possible, eat a healthy diet high in anti-oxidant rich foods, exercise regularly, sleep, and laugh.

The infection is spread from person to person when these body fluids are shared, usually during vaginal or anal sexual contact or when sharing IV drugs. HIV does not live in saliva, tears, urine, or perspiration -- so HIV cannot be spread by casual contact with these body fluids. It can be spread through oral sex, though the risk is small. HIV cannot survive for long outside the human body and dies quickly when the body fluid it's in dries up. It is not spread by animals or insects and is not found on public surfaces. It's actually not as easy to get as other infectious diseases. A mother can pass HIV to her child during birth when the child is exposed to the mother's infected blood. Breastfeeding does carry a risk for HIV infection, though in some areas of the developing world, breastfeeding is considered safer than feeding a newborn contaminated water. There are two main types of HIV, called HIV-1 and HIV-2. HIV-2 is rarely found outside Africa and parts of Asia, so there is no need to test for it specifically -- unless a person has had contact with someone from an area of the world where HIV-2 is common. All of the world's scientists working in the field of AIDS agree that HIV is the cause of the AIDS syndrome. Other theories are not supported by scientific evidence. Dirty needles used for tattoos and body piercing can spread HIV. Be sure these needles are used only once and then thrown away. Blood transfusions were once a concern, but all blood products used in the United States today are tested for several infectious diseases, including HIV. If signs of disease or other problems are found in donated blood, the person who donated the blood is notified to be retested by their health care provider and is not permitted to continue donating blood.

In fact, in studies it only shortened the course of symptoms by about one day. So, your family members should not necessarily expect to feel better quickly when taking oseltamivir. That said, they shouldn't stop taking the medication just because it doesn't seem effective yet. They should take the whole course of oseltamivir, which is usually given as one pill twice a day for five days. Meanwhile, they should be OK to use other remedies, such as acetaminophen (Tylenol), ibuprofen (Motrin) or over-the-counter cough and cold remedies to help them weather the symptoms of flu. Read labels carefully so you don't get overlapping drugs in various products. For example, don't mix two cough-and-cold remedies that both contain acetaminophen. That's dangerous. And don't overlook old-fashioned chicken soup, plenty of fluids, and bed rest. Sometimes that's the only way to get over the flu. If symptoms persist (especially fever and congestion) for more than five days, it's probably a good idea to check back with the doctor.

The adolescent period (ages 12 to 20) are the most psychological and physiological developmental period in which critical changes occur. In teens who consume alcohol these important changes can be hindered. The ability to identify the signs of alcohol abuse and alcoholism in your teen may save his or her life. Parents can help their teens best by being able to recognize the signs of teen alcohol abuse. A dramatic decline in grades, change in behavior and attitude, lost interest in activities that they were once committed to, withdrawing from their usual crowd and spending time with a new crowd; are all indicative that your adolescent could be struggling with alcohol abuse. There are some informative resources available online that can help parents glean insight into teens and alcohol including the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism which not only offers tips on how to talk to your teen about alcohol use, but also help parents be prepared to help their teen.

You are describing a condition called Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome. Withdrawal side effects from alcohol in the body affects individuals differently. Some will experience none to little in the way of side effects while others will have severe physiological and psychological symptoms. Around the 4th or 5th day, the symptoms of Alcohol Withdrawal Syndrome tend to be at their highest level of intensity. At this point in your individual detoxification from alcohol, the acute physiological withdrawal symptoms should be under control. Some of these symptoms may include: sweating, headache, vomiting, low grade fever, black-outs, intense thirst, hallucinating, seizures, hand tremors, racing heartbeats, generalized anxiety, and others. Withdrawal from chronic abuse of alcohol over the course of years is serious business and can result in a medical emergency situation. In situations such as your alcohol withdrawal, medical supervision would have been the preferred method. Your current uncomfortable physical and psychological symptoms should be investigated and not ignored. Based upon your history of heavy alcohol usage, I strongly recommend that you have a complete physical examination A.S.A.P.to assess your overall health. It is possible that some long term neurological conditions and deleterious system changes, or organ damage may have resulted from years of heavy alcohol dependence. No matter what lingering negative symptoms that do remain, you're still ahead of where you would have been without stopping. Over the course of time, the quality of your entire life should improve for the better. I applaud your efforts at restoring normalcy into your life. The challenge now is to remain abstinent from alcohol usage through life style changes and support systems that you put into place.You just got off from a swaying 24 foot ladder at perhaps the 20th foot. If you get back on the same ladder, it will be at the same 20th foot.

The thought of experiencing painful withdrawal symptoms is what prevents millions of individuals from seeking alcohol detox. The truth is that the severity of your symptoms will depend on how much alcohol you have been consuming, the frequency with which you have been drinking and how long you've been doing it. During your alcohol use chemical toxins have been collecting in your system. Detox is the process of flushing those chemical toxins from your body. Your central nervous system has grown accustomed to your alcohol intake, so when you stop drinking, your body may begin to crave something it is used to getting that you are no longer giving it. This is exactly what withdrawal symptoms are and they may present in a number of different ways. Alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be both physical and psychological. Physical symptoms usually include:  Insomnia  Sweating  Headache  Nausea and vomiting  Increased heart rate  Loss of consciousness  Tremors  Seizures Psychological symptoms may also include:  Fatigue  Anxiety  Irritability  Depression Symptoms may begin within a few hours after the last time alcohol was consumed and may last up to 48 to 72 hours. It is important to note that psychological withdrawal may continue long after the physical symptoms subside. Many A.A. members in recovery report having psychological cravings years after they stopped drinking. Another complaint that some people experience during detox, that is more serious, is the occurrence of DTs or delirium tremens. The DTs usually emerge within three to five days after you quit consumption and are periods of confusion, disorientation and hallucinations. Delirium tremens can also be physical such as the shakes and sweating and if left untreated they can be fatal. IV therapy medical detox is seen as one of the best methods for alcohol detox, as it works to reduce the amount of withdrawal symptoms experienced by the individual. IV therapy medical detox should be administered under the supervision of a physician and is relevant because it allows the physician to make any necessary changes to the medication protocol as the withdrawal symptoms change which keep the patient comfortable.

The craving that an alcoholic feels for alcohol can be as strong as the need for food or water. An alcoholic will continue to drink despite serious family, health, or legal problems. Like many other diseases, alcoholism is chronic, meaning that it lasts a person's lifetime; it usually follows a predictable course; and it has symptoms. The risk for developing alcoholism is influenced both by a person's genes and by his or her lifestyle. Is alcoholism inherited? Research shows that the risk for developing alcoholism does indeed run in families. The genes a person inherits partially explain this pattern, but lifestyle is also a factor. Currently, researchers are working to discover the actual genes that put people at risk for alcoholism. Your friends, the amount of stress in your life, and how readily available alcohol is also are factors that may increase your risk for alcoholism. But remember: Risk is not destiny. Just because alcoholism tends to run in families doesn't mean that a child of an alcoholic parent will automatically become an alcoholic too. Some people develop alcoholism even though no one in their family has a drinking problem. By the same token, not all children of alcoholic families get into trouble with alcohol. Knowing you are at risk is important, though, because then you can take steps to protect yourself from developing problems with alcohol. Can alcoholism be cured? No, alcoholism cannot be cured at this time. Even if an alcoholic hasn't been drinking for a long time, he or she can still suffer a relapse. Not drinking is the safest course for most people with alcoholism. Can alcoholism be treated? Yes, alcoholism can be treated. Alcoholism treatment programs use both counseling and medications to help a person stop drinking. Treatment has helped many people stop drinking and rebuild their lives.

Another condition that has been linked to alcohol abuse is Ascites which is the collecting of fluid in the abdomen. If liver disease is not enough, alcohol abuse can result in damage to the heart muscle which can lead to an irregular heart rate, high blood pressure and put the individual at risk for heart attack and stroke. Alcohol abuse has a negative impact on how the brain functions and can influence how the brain processes information, and the way the brain controls the body. Excessive alcohol abuse can interrupt brain signals which relates to behavior and mood changes. Alcohol abuse will interfere with the brains ability of motor control. Alcohol and drug abuse can have a lasting impact on brain development. Individuals who begin drinking at an early age put their thinking futures at risk.

Depending on the severity of alcohol use, when most people quit drinking they will being to experience alcohol withdrawal symptoms. The intensity of the symptoms will depend on the severity of use. If left untreated, alcohol withdrawal symptoms can be fatal which is why most doctors do not recommend trying to quit chronic alcoholism suddenly and without medical assistance. Another problem with alcohol withdrawal is that it can be so painful and uncomfortable that many people return to drinking in order to relieve their symptoms. Medications will work to control the withdrawal symptoms, decrease the amount of stress and anxiety throughout the process and help the patient successfully complete alcohol detox treatment. Although there is no magic pill that will cure alcoholism or stop the desire to drink alcohol, there are a number of medications available that are FDA approved for use in alcoholism treatment including Antabuse, Campral and Naltrexone. Antabuse has been around for more than 50 years. Antabuse is effective by blocking the bodys ability to absorb alcohol and preventing the body to produce the enzyme responsible for alcohol absorption. Instead there is a build-up of acetaldehyde which results in nausea, flushing and palpitations. Unfortunately, Antabuse does not reduce alcohol cravings and should be used in a controlled setting. Campral is an oral medication, taken three times per day and is effective at reducing withdrawal symptoms as a result of abstaining from alcohol. In some people Campral is able to block alcohol withdrawal symptoms from reoccurring after detoxification, but it does not work for everyone. Naltrexone works to reduce alcohol cravings as well as the euphoric feelings individuals get from drinking. Naltrexone is effective by blocking the receptors in the brain. Naltrexone is available in a once-daily pill and a monthly injectible. Other than convenience, the biggest difference is the cost. Naltrexone pill is about $11 per month and the injectible (Vivitrol) is about $1000 per month. After medical detox treatment it is not unusual for the doctor to send patients home with certain medications such as Neurontin, a low dose anti-depressant and/or Vistaril, a non-habit forming anti-anxiety medication to help with post-acute withdrawal. It is important to understand that medication by itself is not enough for successful alcoholism treatment, but should be combined with some type of psycho-social treatment such as cognitive behavioral therapy, motivational enhancement therapy or a 12-step program such as Alcoholics Anonymous.

These medications have been shown to help people with dependence reduce their drinking, avoid relapse to heavy drinking, and achieve and maintain abstinence. Naltrexone acts in the brain to reduce craving for alcohol after someone has stopped drinking. Acamprosate is thought to work by reducing symptoms that follow lengthy abstinence, such as anxiety and insomnia. Disulfiram discourages drinking by making the person taking it feel sick after drinking alcohol. Other types of drugs are available to help manage symptoms of withdrawal (such as shakiness, nausea, and sweating) if they occur after someone with alcohol dependence stops drinking.

Has your teen been noticeably tired or hyperactive? What about their friends, have you noticed that they are not hanging out with the same group?

Each of these sites offer tips on how to talk to your teen about drug abuse. Making yourself aware of what is going on with your teen is the best way to prepare to help them.

Zofran (ondansetron) has been found to be effective in treating alcoholism in people whose problem drinking began before they were 25 years old. Naltrexone (Trexan, ReVia, or Vivitrol) has also been found effective in managing alcoholism. Naltrexone is the most frequently used medication in treating alcoholism. It decreases the alcoholic's cravings for alcohol by blocking the body's euphoric ( high ) response to it. Naltrexone is either taken by mouth on a daily basis or through monthly injections. Disulfiram (Antabuse) is prescribed for about 9% of alcoholics. It decreases the alcoholic's craving for the substance by producing a negative reaction to drinking. Acamprosate (Campral) works by decreasing cravings for alcohol in those who have stopped drinking. However, none of these medications have been specifically approved to treat alcoholism in people less than 18 years of age. Some research indicates that psychiatric medications like lithium and sertraline (Zoloft) may be useful in decreasing alcohol use in teens who have another mental-health disorder in addition to alcohol abuse. There are numerous individual treatments for alcoholism in teens. Relapse prevention uses methods for recognizing and amending problem behaviors. Individualized drug counseling specifically emphasizes short-term behavioral goals in an attempt to help the individual reduce or stop the use of alcohol altogether. Cognitive therapy techniques, like helping the teen recognize what tends to precede and follow their episodes of alcohol use, are often used to address alcohol abuse in teens. Some treatment programs include drug testing. Twelve-step programs like Alcoholics Anonymous are individualized drug-counseling methods. Motivational enhancement therapy encourages the teen to increase their desire to participate in therapy. Stimulus control refers to a treatment method that teaches the person to stay away from situations that are associated with alcohol use and to replace those situations with activities that are contrary to using drugs. Urge control is an approach to changing patterns that lead to drug use. Social control involves family members and other significant others of the alcoholic in treatment. While group therapy can be helpful in decreasing alcohol use in teens, groups that include a number of teens who also engage in disordered behaviors can actually tend to increase alcohol use in this age group. Family interventions for alcoholism that tend to be effective for teens include multidimensional family therapy (MDFT), group therapy, and multifamily educational intervention (MFE). MDFT has been found to be quite effective. Longer-term residential treatment of three to five months that addresses peer relationships, educational problems, and family issues is often used in treating alcoholism in teens. For youth in the first stage of alcohol use (having access, but not having yet used alcohol), preventive measures are used. Therefore, limiting access to alcohol or other drugs, addressing any risk factors of the youth or family, as well as optimal parental supervision and expression regarding expectations are often recommended. The approach to those who have experimented with alcohol should not be minimized by mental-health professionals, since infrequent use can progress to the more serious stages of alcohol use if not addressed. Therefore, professionals recommend that the youth be thoroughly educated about the effects and risks of alcohol, that fair but firm limits be set on the use of alcohol, and that the user be referred for brief counseling, a self-help group, and/or family support group. Teens who have progressed to the more advanced stages of alcoholism are typically treated intensively, using a combination of the medical, individual, and familial interventions already described.

Five stages of alcohol and drug use have been identified. The first stage is described as access to alcohol rather than use of alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, or other drugs. In that stage, minimizing the risk factors that make a teenager more vulnerable to using alcohol are an issue. The second stage of alcohol and other drug use ranges from experimentation or occasional use to regular weekly use of alcohol, tobacco, inhalants, or other drugs. The third stage is characterized by youths further increasing the frequency of alcohol use and/or using alcohol and other drugs on a regular basis. This stage may also include the teenager either buying drugs or stealing to get drugs. In the fourth stage of alcohol and drug use, adolescents have established regular usage, have become preoccupied with getting intoxicated ( high ) and have developed problems in their social, educational, vocational, or family life as a result of using the substance. The final and most serious fifth stage of alcohol or other drug use is defined by the youth only feeling normal when they are using. During this stage, risk-taking behaviors like stealing, engaging in physical fights, or driving while intoxicated increase, and they become most vulnerable to having suicidal thoughts.

The disease is often progressive and fatal. It is characterized by imparted control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking, most notably denial. Each of these symptoms may be continuous or periodic. (1992) The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-III) classified alcoholism as a substance abuse disorder, stating that before the physical part of the disease presents, there are mental, as well as emotional and behavioral symptoms. These symptoms include a loss of control and the inability to stop drinking even as dire consequences are experienced. Alcoholism is a progressive physical disease. Indications of intoxication may include the following  Impaired reflexes and balance issues  Slurred speech  Stomach pain  Vomiting/nausea  Black outs/loss of consciousness Untreated, an individual struggling with alcohol abuse may progress to addiction. Depending on the severity of their use, quitting on their own may be very difficult. Suddenly stopping consumption can result in alcohol withdrawal.

Individuals who are medicated for ADHD and also self-medicating with alcohol and other drugs put themselves at risk for serious health complications as well as psychological damage.

Withdrawal symptoms will vary depending on the type of substance use and in degree, ranging from mild and bearable to intense and painful. The best method for medical detox treatment is one that will control the withdrawal symptoms and keep the patient comfortable throughout the process.

Going through these withdrawal symptoms can be very difficult and can discourage people from wanting to or being able to quit successfully. Perhaps the best thing that you can do is to get help. Treatment options might include visiting a rehabilitation center or a mental health/hospital clinic. Try meeting with support groups, counselors/psychologists, or speaking with a doctor.

It may clear the air for you. There is no scientific evidence to suggest that alcohol use/abuse causes Parkinson?s disease to develop or results in a faster progression of the disease. However, the effects of being drunk or even under a minimum of influence might combine with certain Parkinson-related symptoms to create a dangerous scenario. For example, alcohol use can result in some people feeling off-balance. Combine this with the balance instability of PD and the patient might be putting himself into a dangerous situation where falls and their subsequent injuries (bruises and scrapes, broken bones or concussion, etc.) could occur. The sedative effects of alcohol combined with certain of the antiparkinson medications (which themselves can cause feelings of fatigue or drowsiness) might result in a situation where the patient should not drive or operate different types of machinery due to the increased risks/dangers. Thus, in general, while abstinence is not an automatic requirement when one has Parkinson?s, alcohol use in moderation ? knowing the possible consequences of combining alcohols effects with the symptoms of PD ? is generally recommended.

Also, another popular thing that people do is that they tend to take things like Maalox or Milk of Magnesia if they have an upset stomach and take their pills, you know, with it or within 20 minutes of it.

And how does it work? Well, typically when you have allergy season, your cells are all happy and theyre all behaving. In an allergy attack, they all go crazy. What Singulair tries to do is, it tries to keep them all happy and behaving before it even gets to that point of kind of revolting in a lot of ways.

In order to develop an allergy to a substance, you have to be exposed to it. In other words, it's extremely rare to experience an allergic reaction to something on first exposure. (It's not impossible, but it's fairly rare.) One good example is penicillin. Millions of people took penicillin as children and suffered no ill effects. Many of those people today have penicillin allergies. That early exposure caused their bodies to mount an extreme immune reaction to penicillin later on. That could be what happened to you, too. If a physician confirmed your allergy, you need to take it to heart. Allergies not only can come on later in life, they can get worse over time. So, that diarrhea from eating eggs today could turn into anaphylaxis eventually. You also should be aware that people with a documented egg allergy may be discouraged from getting flu shots.

An allergic reaction is basically the body's overreaction to a perceived threat. If you're exposed to a potential allergen (food, pollen, medication, etc.) the body may not react at all or may produce a mild immune response to that substance. This may not produce symptoms. After multiple exposures to the same allergen, the body may overreact to it, causing an allergic response. This can range from mild (rashes, vomiting) to severe (swelling of the face or throat, difficulty breathing). A severe allergic reaction is called and requires immediate medical attention. If you suspect you have developed an allergy to a substance, I'd suggest you consult your primary health care provider.

The example you cited above contains about 1540 calories. This is a diet for someone who wants to lose weight.

A man who is 6 feet tall and weighs 180 pounds would require many more calories per day, even with no exercise involved. Many people with do,indeed, need to lose weight. You should consult your health care provider or a certified diabetes educator for guidelines on calorie intake. Eating to maintain blood sugar (glucose) levels throughout the day doesn't really revolve around the number of calories consumed.

In Asia, soy is widely consumed by both sexes and I don't think Asian men have worse man-boobs than other men. Men and women both produce estrogen and testosterone. As men age, they produce less testosterone, which may allow estrogen to play a more dominant role, which can lead to man-boobs. In women, aging reduces estrogen production, which may allow their natural testosterone to play a more dominant role, and they may get mustaches. I ask you: which is less fair?
